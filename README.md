Mitron Bank’s customer base is predominantly male (65%) and concentrated in the 25–45 age group, with IT employees forming the largest occupational segment. Spending is highest in Bills, Groceries, and Electronics, with credit cards driving most transaction value (₹216M) and peak activity in September. Mumbai leads in credit card usage (~25% of 216K transactions), followed by Delhi, Chennai, and Bengaluru, while married customers account for most transactions.
